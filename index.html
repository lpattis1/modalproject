          Buffy Summers is the protagonist of BTVS, which depicts her life and
          adventures as she grows up. She is a high school cheerleader who
          learns that she is the Slayer (a Chosen One gifted with the strength
          and skills to fight vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness). The
          series shows Buffy carrying out her destiny in the small town of
          Sunnydale, built atop a portal to hell (Hellmouth), surrounded by a
          group of friends and family who support her in her mission. In the
          comic book continuation, she is a young woman who has accepted her
          duties and is now responsible for training others like her.
